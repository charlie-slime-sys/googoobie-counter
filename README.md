the counter of all time, watch him sloowwwlllyyy mitosis

Goal is to make a new border color palette, something that matches my taste and aesthetic. It looks plain being green for right now. 
 Need to add different options, and a way for everyone to easily access my email so I can actually add more options. 
  Honestly, I think having a pastel color theme would be nice, but I'm not really sure. 

Random future ideas I thought of!!

-dancing nagito/image of nagito standing sprite
-tails miles prower, probably one where he's staring dead ahead
-smg4 mario, I thought it'd be funny? I mean he does multiply in one episode   
-buff monokuma 
-my wobbledog, snacks
-monokuma x2 he just sound funny to multiply
-image of my sona just to label this as mine
